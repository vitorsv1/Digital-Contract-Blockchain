# Digital Contract for Blockchain (Etherium)

The Ethereum Digital Contract Project takes existing paper contracts and places them in a shared blockchain database that all designated parties can use to securely view, review, and accept changes to the contract, all captured on the blockchain ledger. The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger that can be programmed to record virtually all transactions with shared transparency. The result is definitive contracts, stored electronically in a location accessible only by the parties with access, and with versions and activity clearly recorded.
